# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
This project focuses on understanding employee attrition patterns using data analytics and visualization. The goal is to help HR teams identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover and make informed decisions to reduce it.

Key Visualizations:

Age and Attrition: A bar graph shows that younger employees (aged 17-20) have a much higher attrition rate (over 50%) compared to employees in their 30s (6.9%).
Insight: HR should focus on improving job satisfaction for younger employees.

Job Roles and Attrition: Different job roles impact attrition rates, with sales representatives having the highest attrition rate (35.89%) and research directors having the lowest (2.5%).
Insight: HR should provide better benefits to high-turnover roles like sales representatives and technicians.

Monthly Income and Attrition: A line graph shows that as income rises, attrition decreases, but rises again for incomes above $18K.
Insight: HR should improve compensation for low-paid employees and provide better non-monetary benefits for high earners.

Department and Attrition: A packed bubble chart reveals that the sales department has the highest turnover, followed by HR, while R&D has the lowest.
Insight: HR should first address its own department's challenges before tackling turnover in the sales department.

This analysis helps HR teams develop targeted strategies to reduce employee turnover based on data-driven insights.
